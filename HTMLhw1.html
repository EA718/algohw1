<h4>Instructions:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Add bacon and 1/2 cup of the water to a large, non-stick skillet, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.
</li>

<li>Allow to simmer until water evaporates about 6 - 7 minutes, then reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook until bacon is brown and crisp, about 6 - 8 minutes longer.
</li>

<li>Place a fine mesh strainer over a bowl done, poor bacon into strainer wall reserving about 1 tsp of the rendered fat in pan. Return pan to heat and saut√© garlic about 30 seconds, until fragrant and lightly golden.
</li>

<li>Pour into a medium mixing bowl then add 1 tablespoon rendered bacon fat (drippings in bowl set under strainer) to mixing bowl with garlic. Add eggs, egg, yolk, Parmesan, and pepper to garlic mixture and whisk until well combined.
</li>

<li>Meanwhile, bring 8 cups of water to a boil in a large Dutch oven (no more than 8 cups because you want a very starchy water for the sauce). Add spaghetti and salt to boiling water and cook until al dente.
While
Pasta is boiling, set a colander in a large bowl.
</li>

<li>Carefully drain al dente pasta into a colander in bowl, while reserving pasta, water, and bowl. Measure out 1 cup

</li>

<li>Slowly pour and whisk 1/2 cup pasta, water into egg mixture, then slowly pour mixture over pasta while tossing to coat. Add bacon and toss to combine. Season with salt if desired
</li>

<li>Let pasta rest, tossing frequently. 2-4 minutes until sauce slightly and coats pasta. Send with remaining 1/2 cup hot pasta, water as needed. Serve immediately topped with additional parmesan and parsley.
